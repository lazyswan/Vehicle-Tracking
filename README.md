BE-Project : Implemented Real Time Vehicle Tracking System with  built in Data logging

Vehicle Tracking and Data Acquisition System" was aimed at designing an efficient, reliable, economical solution for
tracking vehicles. We developed a robust and compact device equipped with GSM
and GPS which could be mounted easily on any vehicles. This device would
periodically fetch a vehicle's coordinates and log those to its internal storage device. A
user could access real-time location of the vehicle through a call made to the on-board
device. The device would then respond to requested call by sending a text message
containing Short URL of embed map. User could open this link to find the location of
the vehicle on any smartphone with google maps application. Logged Data could also
be used for surveillance of rented vehicles.
